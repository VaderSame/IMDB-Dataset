The production was good; however, the script and acting were B-movie quality. The casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors. The good actors didn't hold their own nor did they lift up the others. <br /><br />This movie is not worthy of more words, but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. play caricatures of themselves in other movies. <br /><br />If you are looking for mindless entertainment, I still wouldn't recommend this movie.\""

       "\"a message movie, but a rather good one. outstanding cast, top to bottom. interesting in that bette davis's plot line is essentially back story! the extremely negative reviews (name throwing at the screenplay/playwright, associating this somehow with extremely negative comments about 'angles in america', etc. etc.) object to the movie being too preachy about germany in wwii. gosh, that is just a bit too sophisticated an understanding of morality for me.theatrical and movie-making, and acting styles vary over time and of course 70 years later this particular movie would not be made in this way. yes casablanca is a better movie (i guess), but although made in the same year and both having nazis in them, casablanca is primarily a love story. the love story in this movie takes second seat to the spy plot--more of a thriller. both have a rather large number of somewhat cheesy accents and wonderful character actors. the children are a bit tedious and could have been edited\""
